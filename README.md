## Milestone
For the Milestone, we presented our fully functional website. The website was an interactive data visualization that allows
 users to explore various hypothesised explanations of drops in US crime rates. This visualization was
 centered around exploring and explaining the drop in crime due to the phasing out of lead in fuel from the Clean Air Act of 1970,
 as well as the legalization of abortion in 1973.
